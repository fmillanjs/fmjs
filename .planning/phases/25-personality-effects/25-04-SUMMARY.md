    provides: "FX-01 text scramble — ScrambleHero component + use-text-scramble hook"
  - phase: 25-02
    provides: "FX-03 Evervault card — EvervaultCard noise decryption component"
  - phase: 25-03
    provides: "FX-04 dot-grid spotlight — DotGridSpotlight component + CSS cursor tracking"
provides:
  - "Phase 25 quality gate — confirmed all three effects work correctly"
  - "Lighthouse CI run confirming performance >= 0.90 on all 5 portfolio URLs with Phase 25 effects in place"
  - "Human visual verification of SC-1 through SC-5"

# Phase 25 Plan 04: Quality Gate Summary

**Lighthouse CI confirmed 0.99-1.00 performance on all 5 portfolio URLs and human observer approved SC-1 through SC-5 for scramble, Evervault card, and dot-grid spotlight effects**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~10 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-19T00:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-19
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 0 (quality gate — no code changes)

## Accomplishments

- Lighthouse CI autorun passed all 5 portfolio URLs with scores 0.99-1.00 (threshold 0.90), confirming Phase 25 effects cause zero performance regression
- Human observer confirmed SC-1: hero name scramble fires once on load, resolves cleanly, never loops
- Human observer confirmed SC-2: Evervault card noise decryption appears on hover, follows cursor inside card boundary, disappears on leave
- Human observer confirmed SC-3: green dot-grid spotlight tracks cursor in real-time on portfolio pages
- Human observer confirmed SC-4: spotlight and dot-grid completely absent under mobile/touch device emulation
- Phase 25 requirements FX-01, FX-03, FX-04 all confirmed complete

## Lighthouse CI Results

| URL | Performance Score |
|-----|------------------|
| / | 0.99 - 1.00 |
| /projects | 0.99 - 1.00 |
| /projects/teamflow | 0.99 - 1.00 |
| /projects/devcollab | 0.99 - 1.00 |
| /contact | 0.99 - 1.00 |

All 5 URLs exceeded the 0.90 threshold. `lhci autorun` exited with code 0.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Production build + Lighthouse CI gate** - `190f5db` (chore)
2. **Task 2: Human verification of all three personality effects** - approved at checkpoint, no code changes

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit — see state updates below)

## Files Created/Modified

- `apps/web/.lighthouseci/` — 33 Lighthouse CI report JSON files generated by lhci autorun (not committed — gitignored)

## Success Criteria Verification

| SC | Description | Result |
|----|-------------|--------|
| SC-1 | Hero name scramble fires once on load, never loops | PASS — human confirmed |
| SC-2 | Evervault card noise on hover, disappears on leave | PASS — human confirmed |
| SC-3 | Green spotlight tracks cursor in real-time | PASS — human confirmed |
| SC-4 | Spotlight completely absent on touch device emulation | PASS — human confirmed |
| SC-5 | Lighthouse CI >= 0.90 on all 5 portfolio URLs | PASS — 0.99-1.00 scores, lhci exit 0 |

All 5 success criteria passed on first attempt. No rework required.

## Decisions Made

- SC-5 (Lighthouse >= 0.90) was pre-verified by the automated Task 1 lhci autorun — the human checkpoint confirmed this via the prior run output rather than running lhci again
- Human approval received on first attempt — all 5 success criteria passed without rework

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. Task 1 automated CI ran cleanly and Task 2 human verification was approved on first attempt.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 25 is complete: FX-01 (text scramble), FX-03 (Evervault card), FX-04 (dot-grid spotlight) all implemented, tested, and human-verified
- v2.5 Matrix Portfolio Overhaul is now complete — all 12 v2.5 requirements (THEME-01 through FX-04 + ANIM-01 through ANIM-03 + UX-01) confirmed done
- Next milestone: Phase 26 (deployment) or v3.0 work as planned in ROADMAP
