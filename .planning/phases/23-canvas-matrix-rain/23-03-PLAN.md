<objective>
Regenerate Playwright visual regression snapshots for the homepage after the Matrix rain canvas is added.

Purpose: The canvas changes pixel values in the hero section. The existing `homepage-light.png` and `homepage-dark.png` snapshots will fail against `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.02` because the canvas layer is now visible. Snapshots must be regenerated to accept the new baseline.
Output: Updated homepage-light and homepage-dark snapshot files. All other route snapshots remain unchanged.

  <name>Task 1: Regenerate homepage visual regression snapshots</name>
  <files>
    apps/web/e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts-snapshots/homepage-light-chromium-linux.png

  <action>
    First, verify the dev server is available. Check if a Docker container is running the apps/web dev server on port 3000:
    ```bash
    docker ps 2>/dev/null | grep -E "3000|apps/web|portfolio" || true
    ```

    Then regenerate ONLY the homepage snapshots using Playwright's `--update-snapshots` flag with a grep filter to limit to homepage tests only. Run from `/home/doctor/fernandomillan/apps/web`:

    ```bash
    npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts --update-snapshots --grep "homepage"
    ```

    The `--grep "homepage"` flag limits regeneration to only the `homepage` named tests in the visual regression suite, leaving all other snapshots (about, projects, teamflow, contact, resume) untouched.

    If the dev server is not running (Playwright needs a running server to take screenshots), start it first. Check `playwright.config.ts` to understand how Playwright handles the server — if it has `webServer` config it will start it automatically. If not, ensure the dev server is running.

    The canvas is animated at runtime; Playwright captures a static frame mid-animation. The snapshot will capture whatever frame is rendered at `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`. This is expected and the snapshot will be a valid baseline for future runs.

    Do NOT run `--update-snapshots` without `--grep "homepage"` — that would regenerate all portfolio snapshots unnecessarily.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run without `--update-snapshots` to confirm tests pass now:
    ```bash
    npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts --grep "homepage"
    ```
    Both `homepage` light and dark tests pass (exit code 0).

    Confirm the other portfolio snapshot tests still pass:
    ```bash
    npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts --grep-invert "homepage"
    ```
    All non-homepage tests pass (exit code 0).
  </verify>
  <done>
    `npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts` exits with code 0. All 12 snapshot tests pass (6 routes × light + dark). Homepage snapshots have been regenerated to include the canvas layer baseline.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Run accessibility tests to confirm canvas aria-hidden passes axe-core</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run the portfolio accessibility test suite to confirm `aria-hidden="true"` on the canvas element prevents any axe-core violations on the homepage:

    ```bash
    npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/accessibility.spec.ts --grep "/"
    ```

    This runs only the `/` (homepage) accessibility tests. axe-core skips elements with `aria-hidden="true"`, so the canvas should not trigger any `canvas-missing-best-practice` or `aria-required-children` violations.

    If violations are reported, they are likely pre-existing or from a different element. Do NOT suppress violations — investigate. The canvas with `aria-hidden="true"` should produce zero violations on its own.
  </action>
  <verify>
    `npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/accessibility.spec.ts --grep "/"` exits with code 0 — zero axe violations on the homepage in both light and dark modes.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Homepage accessibility tests pass. Zero axe-core violations. Canvas element with `aria-hidden="true"` is invisible to the accessibility tree.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks:
1. `npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts` — all 12 tests pass
2. `npx playwright test e2e/portfolio/accessibility.spec.ts --grep "/"` — passes with zero violations
3. `ls apps/web/e2e/portfolio/visual-regression.spec.ts-snapshots/homepage-*` — both light and dark PNG files exist and have recent modification times
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 12 visual regression tests pass (no diff failures)
- Homepage snapshots reflect the new canvas layer as the accepted baseline
- All other portfolio route snapshots are unchanged
- Homepage accessibility tests pass (zero axe violations, canvas is aria-hidden)
</success_criteria>
