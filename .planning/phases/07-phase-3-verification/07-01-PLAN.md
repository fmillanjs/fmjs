<objective>
Verify all Phase 3 real-time collaboration features work end-to-end through comprehensive manual testing, documenting results in a structured verification report.

Purpose: Phase 3 code is complete (plans 03-01 through 03-04) but was never verified. This phase closes that gap by systematically testing WebSocket authentication, live task updates, presence indicators, real-time comments, optimistic UI, and conflict detection across multiple concurrent clients.

Output: 07-VERIFICATION.md documenting test results with evidence (screenshots, console logs, database queries) proving all REAL-01 through REAL-07 requirements are satisfied.

    **Prerequisites:**
    1. Ensure Docker containers are running: `docker ps` (verify postgres + redis containers are healthy)
    2. Start API server: `cd apps/api && npm run start:dev` (wait for "Nest application successfully started")
    3. Start web app: `cd apps/web && npm run dev` (wait for "Ready on http://localhost:3000")
    4. Log in as demo user or create a test account
    5. Navigate to a project page (e.g., demo workspace project)

    **IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES:**
    - For multi-tab testing, use incognito/private mode for Tab B (separate session, avoids connection conflicts)
    - OR log in as different user in Tab B
    - Wait 2-3 seconds after page load for WebSocket connection before starting tests
    - Check browser console for "WS connected" message before proceeding
    - Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`) between test runs to clear cache
