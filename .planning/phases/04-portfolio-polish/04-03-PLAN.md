  <action>
    Create the portfolio route group with its own layout distinct from the dashboard:

    1. **Portfolio layout** (apps/web/app/(portfolio)/layout.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Wraps children with PortfolioNav at top and PortfolioFooter at bottom
       - `min-h-screen flex flex-col` — nav at top, footer at bottom, content fills middle
       - Set metadata: title template "%s | Fernando Millan", default "Fernando Millan - Full-Stack Engineer"
       - description: "Senior full-stack engineer building production-ready SaaS applications"

    2. **Portfolio navigation** (apps/web/components/portfolio/nav.tsx):
       - Client component (needs mobile menu toggle state)
       - Logo/name on left: "Fernando Millan" text, links to /
       - Desktop nav links on right: Home (/), About (/about), Projects (/projects), Resume (/resume), Contact (/contact)
       - Active link highlighting using `usePathname()` from next/navigation
       - Mobile: hamburger menu icon (lucide-react Menu/X icons), slides in nav links
       - Include ThemeToggle component in nav
       - Sticky navigation: `sticky top-0 z-50 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm border-b`
       - Responsive: hidden desktop nav on mobile, shown hamburger; reverse on md+

    3. **Portfolio footer** (apps/web/components/portfolio/footer.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Three columns on desktop, stacked on mobile:
         - Column 1: Name + brief tagline
         - Column 2: Quick links (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
         - Column 3: Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn — use lucide-react icons)
       - Copyright line at bottom: "© 2026 Fernando Millan. All rights reserved."
       - `border-t` separator
       - GitHub link: https://github.com/fernandomillan (placeholder, can be updated)
       - LinkedIn link: placeholder URL

    Colors: Use CSS variables from globals.css (bg-background, text-foreground, etc.)
    NO purple anywhere.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `apps/web/app/(portfolio)/layout.tsx` exists with PortfolioNav and PortfolioFooter imports
    - Navigation has responsive mobile menu
    - Footer has three columns on desktop
    - `npm run build --filter=web` succeeds
    - No purple color values in any file
  </verify>
  <done>
    Portfolio layout renders with sticky navigation at top and footer at bottom. Navigation shows active link, has mobile hamburger menu, and includes theme toggle. Footer shows name, links, and social icons.

  </files>
  <action>
    Create the portfolio home and about pages:

    1. **Hero section component** (apps/web/components/portfolio/hero-section.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Large heading: "Full-Stack Engineer Building Production-Ready SaaS"
       - Or similar professional tagline with Fernando's name prominent
       - Subheading describing specialization (Next.js, NestJS, TypeScript, real-time systems)
       - Two CTA buttons: "View Case Study" → /projects/teamflow, "Get in Touch" → /contact
       - Responsive: text-4xl on mobile, text-6xl on desktop
       - Centered content with generous padding (py-24 md:py-32)
       - Use primary color for emphasized text

    2. **Home page** (apps/web/app/(portfolio)/page.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Metadata: title "Fernando Millan - Full-Stack Engineer"
       - Render HeroSection component
       - Below hero: brief "Featured Project" section with a card linking to /projects/teamflow
         - Card shows: TeamFlow name, brief description, tech badges (Next.js, NestJS, WebSocket, etc.)
       - Optional: brief stats section (e.g., "X+ features built", "Real-time collaboration", "Production-ready")

    3. **Tech stack component** (apps/web/components/portfolio/tech-stack.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Grid of technology badges/cards
       - Categories: Frontend (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind), Backend (NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL), Infrastructure (Docker, Redis, WebSocket, Coolify)
       - Each tech shows name and category
       - Responsive grid: 2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop

    4. **About page** (apps/web/app/(portfolio)/about/page.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Metadata: title "About"
       - Professional bio section (2-3 paragraphs about Fernando as a developer)
         - Focus on: full-stack expertise, production-quality code, scalable architecture
         - Mention experience with modern tech stacks
       - Render TechStack component showing all technologies
       - "What I Value" section: list 3-4 engineering principles (e.g., "Clean Architecture", "Type Safety", "Production Readiness", "Developer Experience")
       - CTA at bottom: "Interested in working together?" with link to /contact

    All content should be placeholder text that Fernando can customize. Use realistic professional copy.

    NO purple colors.
