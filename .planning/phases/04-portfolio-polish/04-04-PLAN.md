  <action>
    Create the projects showcase and detailed TeamFlow case study:

    1. **ProjectCard component** (apps/web/components/portfolio/project-card.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Props: title, description, techStack (string[]), href, featured (boolean)
       - Card layout with: title, description paragraph, row of tech badges, "View Case Study" link
       - Featured card gets larger styling (col-span-2 on desktop, highlighted border)
       - Use border, rounded-lg, p-6, hover shadow transition
       - Dark mode compatible

    2. **Projects page** (apps/web/app/(portfolio)/projects/page.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Metadata: title "Projects"
       - Page heading: "Projects" with subheading "Things I've built"
       - Featured section: TeamFlow as primary project card
         - Description: "A production-ready work management SaaS with real-time collaboration, RBAC, and WebSocket-based live updates"
         - Tech: Next.js, NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSocket, Prisma, Docker
         - Links to /projects/teamflow
       - Optional: 1-2 placeholder cards for future projects (or note "More projects coming soon")
       - Responsive grid layout

    3. **CaseStudySection component** (apps/web/components/portfolio/case-study-section.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Props: title, children (ReactNode)
       - Renders section with heading and content
       - Consistent spacing and typography

    4. **TeamFlow case study page** (apps/web/app/(portfolio)/projects/teamflow/page.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Metadata: title "TeamFlow - Case Study", description covering the project
       - OpenGraph metadata for sharing

       Structure the case study with these sections:

       **a. Overview:**
       - What TeamFlow is (real-time collaborative work management)
       - Key stats: features built, technologies used, timeline
       - Link to live demo (TeamFlow dashboard) and GitHub repo

       **b. Problem:**
       - Managing distributed team work requires real-time visibility
       - Existing tools lack transparency in who's doing what
       - Need for role-based access control in team settings

       **c. Solution:**
       - Built a full-stack SaaS from scratch demonstrating production patterns
       - Key features: Auth, RBAC, Teams, Projects, Kanban, Real-time, Audit logs

       **d. Architecture:**
       - Text-based architecture description (frontend ↔ API ↔ Database flow)
       - Monorepo structure with Turborepo
       - Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router, Server Components, React 19
       - Backend: NestJS with modular architecture, Passport JWT auth, CASL RBAC
       - Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, Redis for sessions and WebSocket pub/sub
       - Real-time: Socket.io with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling

       **e. Key Technical Decisions:**
       - Table or list of 5-7 decisions with rationale:
         - Separate Next.js + NestJS (shows backend skills)
         - WebSockets over Pusher (demonstrates implementation)
         - CASL for RBAC (declarative, type-safe permissions)
         - Redis session + pub/sub (production-ready, scalable)
         - Monorepo with Turborepo (shared types, single CI)
         - Server Components for data fetching (SSR performance)
         - Optimistic UI with automatic rollback (UX polish)

       **f. Challenges & Solutions:**
       - 2-3 real challenges faced during development
       - How each was resolved
       - What was learned

       **g. Results:**
       - Features delivered
       - Technologies demonstrated
       - Link to try the demo

       All content is placeholder that Fernando can customize, but make it realistic and professional.
       Use prose typography for readability: max-w-3xl for text, larger for diagrams/tables.
       NO purple colors.

  <files>

    apps/web/public/resume.pdf
  </files>
  <action>
    Create the resume page and placeholder PDF:

    1. **Resume page** (apps/web/app/(portfolio)/resume/page.tsx):
       - Server Component
       - Metadata: title "Resume"
       - Page heading: "Resume" with download CTA button
       - Download button: `<a href="/resume.pdf" download>` styled as primary button with Download icon (lucide-react)
       - Inline resume content rendered as HTML (so it's crawlable and always visible):

         **Fernando Millan — Full-Stack Engineer**
         (Placeholder content Fernando will update)

         Sections:
         - **Summary**: 2-3 sentences about experience and focus areas
         - **Technical Skills**: Categorized list (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure, Tools)
         - **Experience**: 1-2 placeholder positions with bullet points
         - **Education**: Placeholder
         - **Projects**: TeamFlow with brief description and link to case study

       - Style as a clean, readable document layout (max-w-3xl, prose-like typography)
       - Print-friendly styles (optional: `@media print` considerations)
       - Alternative: "View PDF" button that opens in new tab (target="_blank")

    2. **Placeholder PDF** (apps/web/public/resume.pdf):
       - Create a minimal placeholder file. Since we can't generate a real PDF programmatically without extra dependencies, create a small text note explaining this is a placeholder.
       - Actually, just create the page and note in a comment that Fernando needs to add his real resume.pdf to public/
       - Skip creating a fake PDF — just ensure the download link points to /resume.pdf and the page works without it (show "Resume PDF coming soon" if file doesn't exist, or just link anyway)

    Responsive layout, dark mode support. NO purple.
  </action>

    - Resume page renders with heading and download button
