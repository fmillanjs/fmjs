## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Plans Complete | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| 27 — Infrastructure Foundation | present | **passed** | 3/3 | All 7 requirements satisfied. CI iteration fixed Coolify deploy API format. |
| 28 — DevCollab UI Debt Closure | present | **passed** | 3/3 | 13 automated + 7 human browser tests confirmed passing (28-03-SUMMARY). |

## Live Deployments Confirmed

| Service | URL | DNS |
|---------|-----|-----|
| DevCollab Web | https://devcollab.fernandomillan.me | → 23.21.26.119 |
| DevCollab API | https://devcollab-api.fernandomillan.me | → 23.21.26.119 |
| TeamFlow Web | https://teamflow.fernandomillan.me | → 23.21.26.119 |

CI/CD pipeline: green (commit 1009be4 — "Full CI/CD pipeline green: tests, Lighthouse, 4 GHCR images built and deployed. All Coolify services healthy. Site accessible.")

---

## Integration: 13/14 Wired

All critical integration paths verified. One non-critical UX gap:

**Gap (non-critical): Unauthenticated invite link join**
- `/join/page.tsx` has no auth redirect — unauthenticated users clicking an invite link hit 401 on POST /workspaces/join
- Workaround: user must manually log in first, then revisit the invite URL
- Impact: edge case for demo purposes; primary user is an admin already logged in
- Affects: UI-05 edge case only (not the primary admin-facing flow which is satisfied)

---

## Tech Debt (Non-Critical)

**Phase 27 — Infrastructure:**
- devcollab-api double-migrates on every deploy (Dockerfile CMD + devcollab-migrate service both run `prisma migrate deploy`) — idempotent, safe, minor latency
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL empty-string risk if GHA secret ever removed — `??` fallback doesn't catch `""`; low risk with secret management in place

**Phase 28 — DevCollab UI:**
- Invite link flow doesn't redirect unauthenticated invitees to `/login?redirect=...` — UX dead-end for new users (deferred: UI-08/UI-09 scope)
- NOTIF-01, NOTIF-02 explicitly deferred per REQUIREMENTS.md future requirements list

## Milestone Goal Achievement

> **Goal:** Deploy both SaaS apps to production on Coolify with HTTPS and close all known UI/code gaps so recruiters can interact with live, production-quality applications.

✓ **DevCollab** is live at `https://devcollab.fernandomillan.me` with HTTPS
✓ **TeamFlow** is live at `https://teamflow.fernandomillan.me` with HTTPS
✓ **Portfolio** serves a real resume PDF at `/resume.pdf`
✓ **DevCollab UI** has full member management, auth redirect, and invite link generation
✓ **CI/CD** auto-deploys on push to main — all 4 GHCR images build and push, Coolify deploys on webhook
✓ **All 14 v3.0 requirements satisfied**
