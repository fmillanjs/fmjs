# v4.0 Live QA & Content Polish — Milestone Audit

**Milestone Goal:** Get the portfolio recruiter-ready — fix live demo authentication, audit both apps end-to-end, and update case study content with accurate copy, real metrics, and live screenshots.

**Audited:** 2026-02-26T12:00:00Z (supersedes earlier pass at 07:30:00Z — Phase 37 closed all prior gaps)
**Status:** PASSED
**Phases in scope:** 34, 35, 36, 37

## Executive Summary

All 12 v4.0 requirements are satisfied. Phase 37 (completed 10:00:00Z) created the missing Phase 34 documentation artifacts (34-02-SUMMARY.md, 34-VERIFICATION.md), updated REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes for LIVE-03/LIVE-04, cleaned up the stale .continue-here.md, and marked Phase 34 Complete in ROADMAP.md — closing all gaps that the 07:30 audit pass had identified.

The integration checker confirmed 14 exports wired, 0 orphaned, 0 missing connections, and 4/4 E2E flows complete. Remaining items are human-confirmation notes (not failures) and two minor pre-existing tracking inconsistencies in Phase 37.

| 34 | Live Auth Investigation & Fix | 2/2 | Complete (2026-02-25) |
| 35 | Full QA Audit & Fixes | 3/3 | Complete (2026-02-26) |
| 36 | Content Update | 3/3 | Complete (2026-02-26) |

---

## 2. Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Score | Critical Gaps |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|---------------|
| 34 | ✅ EXISTS (created by Phase 37) | satisfied | 4/4 | None |
| 35 | ✅ EXISTS | human_needed | 1/4 statically, 3/4 human-documented | None |
| 36 | ✅ EXISTS | human_needed | 11/12 | None |
| 37 | ✅ EXISTS | passed | 6/6 | None |

### Phase 34 (satisfied — retrospective via Phase 35 evidence)

Artifacts created by Phase 37: 34-02-SUMMARY.md (6940 bytes), 34-VERIFICATION.md (7366 bytes). Both ground Phase 34 requirements in Phase 35 walkthrough evidence.

- **LIVE-01:** 35-02-SUMMARY login 200 with cookie (automated) + Step 3 PASS (human)
- **LIVE-02:** 35-03-SUMMARY Step 3 login PASS + Step 4 redirect to /teams PASS (human)
- **LIVE-03:** 35-02-SUMMARY automated curl "workspace 200 with 5 snippets + 3 posts" + Steps 5–7 walkthrough PASS
- **LIVE-04:** 35-03-SUMMARY Steps 5–11 walkthrough PASS (after Phase 35 fixes 80283cc + c14a590)

**Anti-patterns:** None — infrastructure and VPS configuration work, no application anti-patterns applicable.

### Phase 35 (human_needed — code fully verified, walkthroughs documented)

| Requirement | Code Verified | Human Walkthrough | SUMMARY Claim |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| QA-01 (DevCollab flow) | ✅ Logout fix (b655251), SSR cookie forward | ✅ 9 steps PASS | ✅ 35-02-SUMMARY [QA-01] |
| QA-02 (TeamFlow flow) | ✅ Session guard (80283cc), Socket.IO race (c14a590) | ✅ 11 steps PASS | ✅ 35-03-SUMMARY [QA-02] |
| QA-03 (Portfolio links) | ✅ href verified statically + Playwright spec | N/A | ✅ 35-01-SUMMARY [QA-03] |
| QA-04 (Lighthouse >= 0.90) | ✅ Config verified (7055480) | ✅ Scores 0.97–1.00 in CI | ✅ 35-03-SUMMARY [QA-04] |

**Anti-patterns:** None found.

### Phase 36 (human_needed — 11/12 statically verified)

| Requirement | Code Verified | Evidence |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| CONT-01 (DevCollab copy) | ✅ | Zero Tiptap refs; react-markdown at 5 locations |
| CONT-02 (TeamFlow copy) | ✅ | Zero v1.1/88% refs; real-time as shipped checkmarks |
| CONT-03 (Badge accuracy) | ✅ | Socket.io, react-markdown, CASL, Prisma across pages |
| CONT-04 (Screenshots) | ✅ code / 👁 visual pending | 4 PNGs present (261KB total); wired into case studies + ProjectCard |

**Anti-patterns:** None found.

### Phase 37 (passed — 6/6)

All six truths verified: 34-02-SUMMARY.md created, 34-VERIFICATION.md created, REQUIREMENTS.md [x] for LIVE-03/04, ROADMAP.md Phase 34 marked Complete, stale .continue-here.md deleted, STATE.md updated. Commits: b94dfb4, 22608af, f327284.

**Minor observations (non-blocking):** ROADMAP.md line 209 plan checklist unchecked (pre-existing pattern; progress table at line 299 is authoritative); STATE.md total_plans: 54 vs 52/52 completed (pre-existing tracking artifact).

**Orphan detection:** No requirements present in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table but absent from all VERIFICATION.md files. All 12 REQ-IDs appear in at least one VERIFICATION.md.

**FAIL gate:** Not triggered. No `unsatisfied` requirements. 12/12 satisfied.
