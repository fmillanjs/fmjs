## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (relevant to v5.0)

- **v4.1:** Screenshots in `apps/web/public/screenshots/` at 1280x800; served via `next/image`
- **v5.0 research:** ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in NestJS only — enforce from day one, never in client components
- **v5.0 research:** No Redis/BullMQ — in-process pipeline with callback-based SSE emitter (sequential steps, not parallel)
- **v5.0 research:** Only email personalization step streams tokens — qualify/enrich use structuredOutput (not renderable incrementally)
- **v5.0 research:** temperature: 0 on all structured output calls — lock before any UI is built on top
- **v5.0 research:** Pre-scrape and cache in seed — never run live scraping during recruiter sessions
- **v5.0 research:** X-Accel-Buffering: no header required on Coolify for SSE to work through Nginx proxy

### Pending Todos

None.
