## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (relevant to v4.1)

- **v4.0:** Screenshots stored in `apps/web/public/screenshots/` at 1280x800; served via `next/image`
- **v3.1:** motion (NOT framer-motion) import from `motion/react` required for React 19 + Next.js 15
- **v2.5:** AnimateIn/StaggerContainer/StaggerItem are the established scroll-reveal animation primitives
- **v2.5:** `--matrix-green: #00FF41` is the canonical accent token; `#0a0a0a` is the canonical dark background
- **v4.0:** Both live apps (teamflow.fernandomillan.me, devcollab.fernandomillan.me) are fully functional with working auth — Playwright can authenticate against them

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
