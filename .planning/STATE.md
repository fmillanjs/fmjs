## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Separate Next.js + NestJS apps: Shows backend architecture skills, not just Next.js API routes
- WebSockets over Pusher: More impressive technically, demonstrates real-time implementation skills
- NextAuth over Clerk: More control and shows auth implementation, not just integration
- Monorepo structure: Professional org-level architecture, easier to showcase
- Demo workspace seeding: Recruiters can immediately interact without setup friction
- Raw TypeScript source imports: Prevents type drift between apps (01-01)
- Redis port 6380: Avoids conflict with existing container (01-01)
- Turborepo tasks field: Using 2.x syntax instead of pipeline (01-01)
- Postgres port 5434: Avoids conflict with system Postgres (01-02)
- Prisma db push for development: Faster iteration than migrations (01-02)
- z.infer types from Zod schemas: Single source of truth for validation + types (01-02)
