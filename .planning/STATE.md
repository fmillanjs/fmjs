All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**v3.0 (Deployment) — Research needed:**
- Coolify per-service webhook trigger behavior for a second app is not fully documented. Plan for hands-on iteration when configuring devcollab-web + devcollab-api deployment pipeline.
- Lock every credential in Coolify UI immediately on first deploy. Verify deployment log shows REDACTED before sharing demo URL.
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL must be set in Coolify environment for devcollab-web — this is the Docker prod gap identified in the v2.0 audit.
