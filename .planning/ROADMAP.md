### 🚧 v2.0 DevCollab (Phases 14-21)

**Milestone Goal:** Build and deploy DevCollab — a developer collaboration platform combining GitHub-style technical content with Discord-style workspace organization, added to the portfolio alongside TeamFlow.

- [x] **Phase 14: Monorepo Scaffold + Infrastructure** - Two new Turborepo apps, separate Postgres, Docker compose extended, deny-by-default CASL guard established before any controllers (completed 2026-02-17)
- [x] **Phase 15: Authentication System** - DevCollab-specific JWT auth (DEVCOLLAB_JWT_SECRET, completely separate from TeamFlow), httpOnly cookie session, deny-by-default RBAC guard with unit tests (completed 2026-02-17)
- [ ] **Phase 16: Workspaces + Membership + RBAC** - Workspace CRUD with slug routing, invite-link flow, Admin/Contributor/Viewer roles enforced at guard level, last-admin protection
- [ ] **Phase 17: Content Creation — Snippets + Posts** - Code snippets with Shiki syntax highlighting, Markdown posts with Tiptap write/preview editor (immediatelyRender: false validated with next build && next start)
- [ ] **Phase 18: Discussions + Reactions** - Threaded comments (1-level deep) on snippets and posts, emoji reactions, flat model with in-memory tree assembly
- [ ] **Phase 19: Notifications + Activity Feed** - @mention notifications with bell icon, unread badge, 60s poll; workspace activity feed with 30s poll and cursor pagination
- [ ] **Phase 20: Full-Text Search** - Postgres tsvector with trigger pattern (NOT Meilisearch), GIN index, Cmd+K modal, grouped results with ts_headline() highlighting; validated with prisma migrate dev x3 ritual
- [ ] **Phase 21: Seed Data + Portfolio Integration** - Demo workspace with all three roles demonstrated, deterministic faker seed, portfolio card + case study + live demo link

## Phase Details

### Phase 14: Monorepo Scaffold + Infrastructure
**Goal**: Two new Turborepo apps (devcollab-web on port 3002, devcollab-api on port 3003) run in Docker alongside TeamFlow; the deny-by-default CASL guard is installed before any feature controllers exist
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (v1.1 complete)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `docker compose up` starts devcollab-postgres (port 5435), devcollab-api (port 3003), and devcollab-web (port 3002) with healthy status; TeamFlow containers are unaffected
  2. `GET /health` on devcollab-api returns 200; devcollab-web shows a login placeholder page at port 3002
  3. `packages/devcollab-database` Prisma client is generated with its own output path (not overwriting TeamFlow's `@prisma/client`); initial migration is applied to devcollab-postgres
  4. A dedicated `migrate` service runs `prisma migrate deploy` and exits before devcollab-api starts (no migration race condition)
  5. CI/CD pipeline builds and pushes devcollab-web and devcollab-api images to GHCR on push to main
**Plans**: 4 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md — packages/devcollab-database: Prisma schema, isolated client, Dockerfile.migrate
- [ ] 14-02-PLAN.md — apps/devcollab-api (NestJS 11, CASL guard, /health) + apps/devcollab-web (Next.js 15, login placeholder)
- [ ] 14-03-PLAN.md — docker-compose.yml: devcollab-postgres, devcollab-migrate, devcollab-api, devcollab-web, MinIO
- [ ] 14-04-PLAN.md — CI/CD: build-and-push-devcollab job for GHCR

### Phase 15: Authentication System
**Goal**: Users can sign up, log in, and maintain sessions in DevCollab using a completely separate JWT system from TeamFlow; deny-by-default RBAC guard is unit-tested before any feature routes exist
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A new user can create a DevCollab account with email and password; the account is isolated from TeamFlow (no shared user table, no shared JWT secret)
  2. A user can log in with email and password and receive an httpOnly cookie; the cookie persists the session across browser refresh
  3. A user can log out and the session cookie is cleared; subsequent requests without a cookie are rejected
  4. Any DevCollab API endpoint without a `@CheckAbility` decorator returns 403 (ForbiddenException), not 200 — verified by unit test enumeration of all controller methods
**Plans**: 5 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 15-01-PLAN.md — Prisma password migration + env vars (DEVCOLLAB_JWT_SECRET in .env and docker-compose)
- [ ] 15-02-PLAN.md — API foundation: auth deps in package.json, cookie-parser + CORS in main.ts, @CheckAbility/@CurrentUser decorators, CaslAuthGuard upgrade
- [ ] 15-03-PLAN.md — Auth feature: DatabaseModule, AuthModule, AuthService, AuthController (signup/login/logout/me), JwtStrategy, AppModule wiring
- [ ] 15-04-PLAN.md — devcollab-web: login form, signup form, logout route handler, dashboard placeholder
- [ ] 15-05-PLAN.md — TDD meta-test: Vitest setup + controller-coverage spec (deny-by-default invariant enforced in CI)

### Phase 16: Workspaces + Membership + RBAC
**Goal**: Users can create workspaces, invite members via time-limited single-use links, and have role-based permissions enforced at the API guard level — Admin, Contributor, and Viewer roles all behave correctly
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: WORK-01, WORK-02, WORK-03, WORK-04, WORK-05, RBAC-01, RBAC-02, RBAC-03, RBAC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A logged-in user can create a workspace with a name and slug; the workspace is accessible at `/w/:slug`
  2. A workspace Admin can generate an invite link; the link expires after 72 hours and cannot be reused after the first successful join
  3. A user with an invite link can join the workspace and is assigned the Contributor role by default
  4. A Viewer-role user receives 403 when attempting to create a snippet or post; a Contributor-role user succeeds — role enforcement is at the API level, not only in the UI
  5. The last Admin in a workspace cannot be removed or demoted; the API returns an error and the member list is unchanged
**Plans**: 4 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — Prisma schema: Workspace, WorkspaceMember, InviteLink models + PrismaService accessors
- [ ] 16-02-PLAN.md — WorkspaceAbilityFactory + async CaslAuthGuard + AppModule wiring
- [ ] 16-03-PLAN.md — WorkspacesService + WorkspacesController (8 endpoints) + DTOs
- [ ] 16-04-PLAN.md — Controller meta-test update + Next.js 15 workspace UI pages

### Phase 17: Content Creation — Snippets + Posts
**Goal**: Contributors can create and share code snippets with syntax highlighting and Markdown posts with a write/preview editor; both content types are readable by all workspace members; Tiptap SSR is validated against a production build
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: SNIP-01, SNIP-02, SNIP-03, SNIP-04, SNIP-05, POST-01, POST-02, POST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A user can create a code snippet with a title, language selector, and code body; the snippet renders with Shiki syntax highlighting (server-side, zero client JS); a copy button copies the code to clipboard
  2. Each snippet has a shareable URL (`/w/:slug/snippets/:id`) accessible to any workspace member; the URL works when opened in a new tab (GitHub Gist-style)
  3. A user can create a Markdown post using a write/preview split-pane editor; the preview renders Shiki-highlighted code fences
  4. A user can save a post as draft (not visible to others) or publish it (visible to all workspace members); a published post can be reverted to draft
  5. `next build && next start` completes with zero React hydration errors and zero "Duplicate extension names" Tiptap warnings in the browser console — SSR validation is a hard acceptance criterion before merge
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 18: Discussions + Reactions
**Goal**: Workspace members can comment on snippets and posts in a threaded structure (one level of replies), edit and delete their own comments, and react to content with emoji reactions
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: DISC-01, DISC-02, DISC-03, DISC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A user can post a top-level comment on any snippet or post; the comment appears immediately with the author's name and timestamp
  2. A user can reply to a top-level comment (one level deep); reply-to-reply is not possible — the UI does not offer that action
  3. A user can edit their own comment (an "edited" timestamp appears) and delete it (content becomes "[deleted]" preserving thread structure); an Admin can hard-delete any comment
  4. A user can add a reaction (thumbs up, heart, +1, laugh) to a post or comment; reaction counts update without a full page reload; a second click on the same reaction removes it
  5. The total number of Prisma queries per thread fetch stays below 5 (flat model + in-memory tree assembly — no N+1 recursive include)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 19: Notifications + Activity Feed
**Goal**: Users are notified when mentioned by @name in comments; the workspace activity feed shows a reverse-chronological stream of workspace events; both surfaces use polling (not WebSockets)
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: NOTF-01, NOTF-02, NOTF-03, FEED-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a user types `@name` in a comment and saves it, the mentioned user sees a new notification; the notification count in the bell icon increments within 60 seconds (poll interval)
  2. The bell icon displays an unread badge with the correct count; clicking the bell shows the notification list with a link to the source comment
  3. A user can mark individual notifications as read or mark all as read; the unread badge updates immediately
  4. The workspace activity feed shows workspace events (member joins, content created, content updated) in reverse-chronological order, paginated with cursor pagination at 20 per page; the feed refreshes within 30 seconds without a page reload
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 20: Full-Text Search
**Goal**: Workspace members can search across all posts and snippets using full-text search powered by Postgres tsvector; results are grouped and highlighted; the Cmd+K shortcut opens the search modal; GIN index migration drift is eliminated
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A user can type a search query in the search bar and receive results scoped to their current workspace; results include both posts and snippets; search works with partial words (prefix matching)
  2. Search results are grouped into "Posts" and "Snippets" sections; matching terms are highlighted with `ts_headline()` so the user can see why each result matched
  3. Pressing `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) opens the global search modal from any page; pressing `Escape` or clicking outside closes it
  4. Running `prisma migrate dev` three consecutive times generates zero new migration files on runs 2 and 3 — GIN index migration drift is eliminated by the trigger-based tsvector pattern
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 21: Seed Data + Portfolio Integration
**Goal**: The DevCollab demo workspace contains realistic content demonstrating all three roles; the portfolio site presents DevCollab with a project card, case study, and live demo link; recruiters can interact with the demo immediately on first visit
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: PORT-01, PORT-02, PORT-03, SEED-01, SEED-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On first launch (empty database), the seed script creates a demo workspace with at least 3 user accounts (one Admin, one Contributor, one Viewer), 5+ snippets in varied languages, 3+ published posts with discussions including @mentions, and an activity feed with visible history
  2. The seed is deterministic: running the seed script twice produces identical content (fixed `faker.seed()` number); no duplicate entries are created on re-run
  3. Fernando's portfolio homepage displays a DevCollab project card alongside the TeamFlow card; the card includes a live demo link that opens DevCollab in the demo workspace
  4. A DevCollab case study page exists at `/projects/devcollab` with technology choices, architecture decisions, and lessons learned documented; the case study links to the live demo and source code
**Plans**: TBD
