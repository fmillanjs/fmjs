### v4.0 Live QA & Content Polish (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Get the portfolio recruiter-ready — fix live demo authentication, audit both apps end-to-end, and update case study content with accurate copy, real metrics, and live screenshots.

- [ ] **Phase 34: Live Auth Investigation & Fix** - Diagnose and fix broken login on DevCollab and TeamFlow live deployments
- [x] **Phase 35: Full QA Audit & Fixes** - End-to-end exploratory audit of both live apps and all portfolio links with Lighthouse gate
- [x] **Phase 36: Content Update** - Rewrite case study copy, update tech stack metrics, and capture live screenshots

## Phase Details

### Phase 29: Lenis Foundation
**Goal**: Users experience inertia-based smooth scroll across all portfolio pages with zero side effects on the TeamFlow dashboard, CommandPalette, navigation, or reduced-motion users
**Depends on**: Phase 28 (v3.0 complete)
**Requirements**: SCROLL-01, SCROLL-02, SCROLL-03, SCROLL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User scrolling any portfolio page (`/`, `/projects`, `/projects/teamflow`, `/projects/devcollab`, `/contact`) feels inertia-based smooth scroll instead of native instant scroll
  2. User clicking a nav link to a different portfolio page always arrives at the top of the destination page, not mid-page
  3. User with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` set in OS gets native browser scroll — no Lenis instance is initialized, no RAF overhead runs
  4. User opening the CommandPalette (Cmd+K) cannot scroll the background page while the modal is open; background scroll resumes on close
  5. User navigating to the TeamFlow dashboard sees no Lenis interference — TanStack Table virtual scroll and Socket.io behavior are identical to pre-Phase-29
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 29-01-PLAN.md — LenisProvider component (prefers-reduced-motion gate, LenisScrollReset inner, autoRaf: true) + globals.css Lenis CSS import + portfolio layout wiring
- [ ] 29-02-PLAN.md — CommandPalette lenis.stop/start integration + human browser verification of all 4 SCROLL requirements
- [ ] 29-03-PLAN.md — Lighthouse CI gate verification (all 5 portfolio URLs >= 0.90 performance)

### Phase 30: GSAP ScrollTrigger Parallax
**Goal**: Users scrolling the portfolio hero and past section separators perceive distinct depth layers — hero text drifting upward slower than the page, decorative lines moving at an independent rate — without any layout shift or Lighthouse regression
**Depends on**: Phase 29 (Lenis ticker sync must be established)
**Requirements**: PRLLX-01, PRLLX-02, PRLLX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User scrolling the hero section sees the hero text block drift upward visibly slower than the page scroll speed (yPercent: -15, scrub: 1)
  2. User scrolling past section dividers sees decorative lines shift at an independent depth from the surrounding content (subtle scale or y transform, no abrupt jump)
  3. Lighthouse CI performance score is >= 0.90 on all five portfolio URLs with parallax active — CLS is 0 (no `pin: true` spacers, transform-only properties only)
  4. User navigating away from a parallaxed page and returning sees the animations fire correctly — no stale ScrollTrigger instances or frozen positions
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 30-01-PLAN.md — LenisProvider autoRaf: false + LenisGSAPBridge ticker sync + hero text parallax (yPercent: -15, scrub: 1)
- [x] 30-02-PLAN.md — ParallaxDivider component (scaleX depth effect) + homepage/page inserts + Lighthouse CI gate (CLS = 0, all 5 URLs >= 0.90)

### Phase 31: Magnetic Buttons
**Goal**: Users hovering the hero CTAs and contact CTA experience spring-physics cursor attraction; users on touch devices or with reduced-motion preference see a plain button with no behavior change
**Depends on**: Phase 29 (Lenis stable; isolates debugging surface)
**Requirements**: MAGN-01, MAGN-02, MAGN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User hovering the "View Projects" hero CTA sees the button attract toward the cursor position with spring elasticity and snap back smoothly on cursor leave
  2. User hovering the "View GitHub" hero CTA sees the same spring-physics magnetic attraction
  3. User hovering the "Get In Touch" contact CTA sees the same magnetic spring behavior
  4. User on a touch device (phone, tablet) tapping any CTA sees a plain button press — no position shift, no magnetic artifact
  5. User with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` active sees a plain button — the MagneticButton component renders a static wrapper with no motion values
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 31-01-PLAN.md — MagneticButton 'use client' component (motion/react useMotionValue + useSpring + useReducedMotion + any-hover guard + getBoundingClientRect caching)
- [ ] 31-02-PLAN.md — Wire MagneticButton to hero CTAs (rename "Learn More" → "View Projects") + about page "Get In Touch" + Lighthouse CI gate (performance >= 0.90)

### Phase 32: Matrix Color Harmony
**Goal**: Every portfolio section uses Matrix green tokens consistently — no blue Radix primary colors remain visible anywhere in the portfolio — and all 18 Playwright visual regression baselines are updated and passing
**Depends on**: Phase 29 (can run independently of 30/31, but after 29 for stable scroll context)
**Requirements**: COLOR-01, COLOR-02, COLOR-03, COLOR-04, COLOR-05, COLOR-06, COLOR-07, COLOR-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Four new CSS tokens (`--matrix-green-subtle`, `--matrix-green-border`, `--matrix-scan-line`, `--matrix-terminal`) are defined and scoped to `.matrix-theme` in globals.css
  2. User visiting the About page sees no blue gradient or blue card borders — all value card borders and CTA gradient use Matrix green tokens
  3. User visiting the Contact page sees heading accents and CTA styling in Matrix green, not blue Radix primary
  4. User visiting either case study page (`/projects/teamflow`, `/projects/devcollab`) sees metric numbers rendered in Matrix green monospace — no blue accent numbers
  5. User seeing tech-stack badges notices green token borders instead of blue Radix primary; footer link hover states show Matrix green instead of blue
  6. User viewing any portfolio `<h2>` section heading sees a terminal-style label prefix (`> SECTION_NAME`) above it in Matrix green monospace
  7. All 18 Playwright visual regression snapshots pass at maxDiffPixelRatio 0.02 after baseline update; navigating to TeamFlow dashboard shows zero Matrix green bleed
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 32-01-PLAN.md — CSS tokens (COLOR-01) + SectionLabel component + About page color sweep (COLOR-02) + hero subtitle fix
- [ ] 32-02-PLAN.md — Contact page (COLOR-03) + CaseStudySection SectionLabel + TeamFlow/DevCollab case studies (COLOR-04) + resume SectionLabels (COLOR-07 partial)
- [ ] 32-03-PLAN.md — Footer hover states (COLOR-06) + tech-stack + parallax-divider + homepage cards/stats/SectionLabel (COLOR-05 + COLOR-07)
- [ ] 32-04-PLAN.md — Playwright baseline update + all 18 snapshots green + dashboard isolation check + human visual verify (COLOR-08)

### Phase 33: Footer Redesign + Matrix Animation
**Goal**: Users reaching the footer experience a terminal-themed close — dark background, scanline texture, terminal-prompt social links, `> EOF` tagline, and a single-fire CSS glitch on the signature name — with all links keyboard-accessible and all 18 visual regression snapshots passing
**Depends on**: Phase 32 (consumes the four new CSS tokens defined there)
**Requirements**: FOOTER-01, FOOTER-02, FOOTER-03, FOOTER-04, FOOTER-05, FOOTER-06, FOOTER-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User seeing the footer notices a `#0a0a0a` background with a Matrix green top border — no `bg-muted` gray background remains
  2. User reading the social links sees them formatted as `> github`, `> linkedin`, `> email` in monospace Matrix green, not plain anchor text
  3. User reading the footer bottom sees a `> EOF` tagline as a narrative close before the copyright line
  4. User viewing the footer sees a CRT scanline texture overlay rendered via CSS `::before` pseudo-element — no JavaScript, no canvas, no animation library
  5. User scrolling the "Fernando Millan" footer signature into view for the first time sees a single CSS glitch animation fire exactly once — subsequent scrolls show the static text with no repeat
  6. User tabbing through the footer with a keyboard sees all social links receive a visible focus ring in the correct position
  7. All 18 Playwright visual regression snapshots pass at maxDiffPixelRatio 0.02 after footer baseline update; reduced-motion users see a static footer with all animations disabled
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 33-01-PLAN.md — Footer static shell redesign: #0a0a0a background, --matrix-green-border top border, CRT scanlines CSS ::before, terminal social links (> github/linkedin/email), > EOF tagline
- [ ] 33-02-PLAN.md — GlitchSignature 'use client' island: IntersectionObserver single-fire + next/dynamic ssr:false wired into footer.tsx
- [ ] 33-03-PLAN.md — Accessibility audit (axe WCAG AA, keyboard focus rings) + Playwright baseline update + all 18 snapshots green + human visual approval

### Phase 34: Live Auth Investigation & Fix
**Goal**: Recruiters can log into both DevCollab and TeamFlow live demos using seeded credentials and land directly in the demo workspace or project with all seeded content visible
**Depends on**: Phase 33 (v3.1 complete)
**Requirements**: LIVE-01, LIVE-02, LIVE-03, LIVE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User visiting `devcollab.fernandomillan.me/login` and entering seeded demo credentials is authenticated and redirected to the demo workspace — no error, no loop, no blank screen
  2. User visiting `teamflow.fernandomillan.me` and entering seeded demo credentials is authenticated and lands on the TeamFlow project dashboard
  3. After DevCollab login, user sees the seeded workspace with snippets, posts, and members populated — not an empty state
  4. After TeamFlow login, user sees tasks across columns, drag-and-drop works, and real-time presence indicator is functional
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 34-01-PLAN.md — Diagnostic script + devcollab-seed in compose + VPS diagnosis checkpoint
- [ ] 34-02-PLAN.md — Code fixes, seed scripts, Coolify env var guide, redeploy + end-to-end login verification

### Phase 35: Full QA Audit & Fixes
**Goal**: Every recruiter-facing flow on both live apps completes without errors, all portfolio links resolve correctly, and Lighthouse scores remain >= 0.90 on all 5 public URLs
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (live auth must work before flows can be audited end-to-end)
**Requirements**: QA-01, QA-02, QA-03, QA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User completing the full DevCollab recruiter flow (login → workspace → view snippet → search content → check notifications) encounters no errors, broken UI, or dead ends
  2. User completing the full TeamFlow recruiter flow (login → project → create/move task → observe real-time presence) encounters no errors or broken functionality
  3. User clicking every navigation link, project card CTA, case study link, and footer link on `fernandomillan.me` reaches the correct destination with no 404s or broken anchors
  4. Lighthouse CI reports performance >= 0.90 on all five public portfolio URLs (`/`, `/projects`, `/projects/teamflow`, `/projects/devcollab`, `/contact`) after all fixes applied
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 35-01-PLAN.md — Fix TeamFlow CTA link bug (href=/teams → absolute production URL) + extend Playwright nav spec with CTA href assertions (QA-03)
- [x] 35-02-PLAN.md — DevCollab recruiter walkthrough: API health check + human browser flow audit + fix any bugs found (QA-01)
- [x] 35-03-PLAN.md — TeamFlow recruiter walkthrough: health check + human browser flow audit + Lighthouse CI gate all 5 URLs >= 0.90 (QA-02, QA-04)

### Phase 36: Content Update
**Goal**: Both case studies accurately describe the shipped features, architecture decisions, and technical depth; tech stack badges reflect the real stack; and live app screenshots are displayed in both case studies and project cards
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (live apps must be functional for screenshots), Phase 35 (all UI bugs resolved before capturing reference screenshots)
**Requirements**: CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, CONT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User reading the DevCollab case study encounters accurate descriptions of CASL RBAC, tsvector full-text search, Tiptap v3 editor, and Shiki syntax highlighting — no placeholder copy or inaccurate claims
  2. User reading the TeamFlow case study encounters accurate descriptions of Socket.io real-time collaboration, dnd-kit drag-and-drop, NextAuth v5 JWT strategy, and the audit log — no placeholder copy or inaccurate claims
  3. User viewing tech stack badges and metric numbers on either case study sees the actual shipped stack (Next.js 15, NestJS 11, Prisma, Postgres, etc.) and real measurable numbers — no fabricated metrics
  4. User viewing both case studies and the project cards on `/projects` sees real screenshots captured from the live running apps — no placeholder images or missing visuals
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 36-01-PLAN.md — Correct DevCollab case study: remove Tiptap, add react-markdown (CONT-01)
- [x] 36-02-PLAN.md — Rewrite TeamFlow case study: remove v1.1 framing, real-time as shipped (CONT-02)
- [x] 36-03-PLAN.md — Fix badge arrays + capture 4 live screenshots + wire into case studies and project cards (CONT-03, CONT-04)
