# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-16T14:30:00Z
**Status:** GAPS_FOUND
**Overall Score:** 79% requirements satisfied (53/67)

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.0 has made substantial progress with **5 of 7 phases verified** and **96% integration health**. Core functionality is operational: authentication, RBAC, teams, projects, tasks, Kanban boards, and portfolio website all working. However, **2 critical gaps block milestone completion**:

1. **Phase 3 missing verification** - Real-time collaboration features implemented but not verified
2. **Phase 4 incomplete** - E2E tests and deployment configuration missing

## Requirements Coverage

### By Phase

| Phase | Requirements | Satisfied | Partial | Unsatisfied | Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | 26 | 26 (100%) | 0 | 0 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| **Phase 2** | 27 | 27 (100%) | 0 | 0 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| **Phase 3** | 8 | ? | ? | ? | ❌ UNVERIFIED |
| **Phase 4** | 23 | 20 (87%) | 3 | 0 | ⚠️ GAPS |
| **Phase 5.1** | 0 | - | - | - | ✓ VERIFIED |
| **Phase 6** | 0 | - | - | - | ⏸️ PENDING |
| **Phase 6.1** | 0 | - | - | - | ✓ VERIFIED |
| **TOTAL** | **67** | **53** | **3** | **8** | **79%** |

### Unsatisfied Requirements (Blockers)

#### Phase 3: Real-Time Collaboration (8 requirements)

**Status:** UNVERIFIED - Phase marked complete but missing VERIFICATION.md

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| REAL-01 | User sees live updates when tasks are created | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| REAL-02 | User sees live updates when tasks move between columns | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| REAL-03 | User sees live updates when task details change | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| REAL-04 | User sees live updates when comments are added | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| REAL-05 | User sees presence indicators | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| REAL-06 | User sees optimistic UI updates with rollback | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| REAL-07 | System handles concurrent edits with conflict detection | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |
| TECH-09 | WebSocket events use Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling | Phase 3 | Missing phase verification |

**Impact:** BLOCKER - Cannot confirm real-time features work as intended without verification

**Evidence:**
- Phase marked complete in ROADMAP.md (line 17)
- No VERIFICATION.md found in `.planning/phases/03-real-time-collaboration/`
- Integration checker confirms code is complete and integrated
- Runtime testing pending

### Partial Requirements (Warnings)

#### Phase 4: Portfolio & Polish (3 requirements)

| Requirement | Description | Status | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| TEST-02 | Authentication has E2E tests | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Playwright E2E tests for auth flows not implemented (Plan 04-09 incomplete) |
| DEPLOY-02 | Application deploys to Coolify | ⚠️ PARTIAL | CI/CD pipeline exists but Coolify webhook not configured |
| DEPLOY-04 | Application has CI/CD pipeline | ⚠️ PARTIAL | GitHub Actions workflow exists but deployment step requires COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL secret |
| DEPLOY-05 | Portfolio and TeamFlow deployed with custom domains | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Infrastructure code exists but not actually deployed |

**Impact:** WARNING - Core functionality works but testing/deployment incomplete

**Mitigation:**
- Unit tests exist for RBAC and contact validation
- Integration tests cover schema validation
- Manual testing completed per Phase 06.1
- Deployment deferred to post-development setup

**Total:** 8/8 dependencies verified (2 code-ready pending Phase 3 verification)

## Tech Debt by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication

- **Email utility uses console logging** - Production SMTP deferred to post-launch
- **No E2E tests yet** - Deferred to Phase 4, but Phase 4 incomplete

**Severity:** ℹ️ INFO - Documented technical debt, non-blocking

### Phase 4: Portfolio & Polish

- **Resume PDF placeholder missing** - Download link will 404 until PDF added
- **Contact form logs to console** - Should use email service or database storage
- **Home page says "Full case study coming soon"** - Case study exists but CTA text outdated

**Severity:** ⚠️ WARNING - User-facing issues but not critical

### Cross-Cutting

- **Middleware protection disabled** - `middleware.ts.disabled` - Route protection moved to component-level
- **validatedApi partial adoption** - Only teams page uses runtime validation, projects/tasks still use raw API

**Severity:** ℹ️ INFO - Architectural decisions, documented

## Recommendations

### Critical Path to Milestone Completion

#### 1. Close Phase 3 Gap (BLOCKER)

**Action:** Create VERIFICATION.md for Phase 3

**Steps:**
1. Run `/gsd:verify-work` for Phase 3 to generate verification report
2. Manually test WebSocket connection with JWT_SECRET fix
3. Verify all 8 REAL-* requirements and TECH-09
4. Document findings in `03-VERIFICATION.md`

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours (includes manual testing)

#### 2. Close Phase 4 Gaps (WARNING)

**Action:** Implement missing E2E tests OR accept technical debt

**Option A - Complete Testing:**
- Implement Playwright auth E2E tests (Plan 04-09)
- Verify login, signup, password reset flows
- Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

**Option B - Accept Debt:**
- Mark TEST-02 as deferred to v1.1
- Document manual testing completed in Phase 06.1
- Add to tech debt backlog
- Estimated effort: 30 minutes (documentation)

**Recommendation:** Accept debt (Option B) - Manual testing complete, automated tests low ROI for solo developer

#### 3. Deployment Configuration (WARNING)

**Action:** Configure Coolify deployment OR defer to post-development

**Option A - Deploy Now:**
- Set up Coolify application
- Configure COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL secret in GitHub
- Configure environment variables in Coolify
- Set up custom domains
- Estimated effort: 4-8 hours (including DNS propagation)

**Option B - Defer:**
- Mark DEPLOY-* requirements as "infrastructure ready, deployment pending"
- Complete after milestone acceptance
- Focus on feature verification first
- Estimated effort: 30 minutes (documentation)

**Recommendation:** Defer (Option B) - Code ready, deployment is operational task not feature work

## Milestone Completion Path

**Milestone Status:** GAPS_FOUND

**Critical Blockers:**
1. Phase 3 missing VERIFICATION.md
2. Phase 4 E2E tests incomplete
3. Deployment not configured

**Recommendation:** Close Phase 3 gap (2-3 hours), accept Phase 4 technical debt (30 minutes), defer deployment to post-milestone. This path achieves core value delivery while maintaining velocity.

**Next Action:** Run `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` to create closure plans OR accept debt and proceed to `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.0`
